I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University.

I am advised by [Dr. Alok Choudhary](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/choudhary-alok.html) and [Dr. Wei-keng Liao](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/liao-wei-keng.html).

My research interest is in distributed systems and HPC.
