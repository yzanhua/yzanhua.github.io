I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

I am advised by [Dr. Alok Choudhary](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/choudhary-alok.html) and [Dr. Wei-keng Liao](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/liao-wei-keng.html) in the [CUCIS](http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/index.html) group.

My research interest is in distributed systems and HPC. Currently, I am focusing on improving I/O performances for HDF5 and MPI.
